        <h1>Abstract</h1>
        <p>The important issue of special education services is the special education teacher who have been trained on
            instruction strategies for children with special needs. Special education teachers have been trained in short term
            in-service education programs and certificate programs in Turkey until 1983, after 1983 special education
            teachers are being trained by the universities in the undergraduate programs.</p>
        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Regular education of Turkey included pre-school, primary school, secondary school, further education colleges,
            and higher education. Special education is an important part of Turkish education system. Ministry of Education
            is responsible for the organization both of regular education and special education in Turkey. The individuals in
            need of special education are protected by the Special Education Law 573. This law arranges the services of
            Special Education.</p>
        <h1>Special Education Teacher Training Programs in Turkey</h1>
        <p>In Turkey as it is throughout the world, the training of special education teachers can be at the undergraduate,
            graduate or doctorate levels. The teacher training of special education teachers started in 1952 at Gazi Institute of
            Education as a two year undergraduate program. In later years the needs of special education training has been
            met by short term certificate programs (Ataman, 2004). In addition to these certificate programs, the teachers
            from three year programs were taken into a one term graduate program; however, this program failed due to the
            fact that candidates did not complete the program.</p>
        <p>Special Education Department is a four-year teacher education program which aims to train special education
            teachers for the education of the students with special needs. Special Education Teacher Training Programs
            actively train teachers for different kinds of handicapped. Special Education Programs include Departments of
            Mentally Handicapped, Hearing Impaired, and Visually Impaired. Recently, the Teacher Training Program for
            Gifted Individuals is established.</p>
            
        <p>The teacher candidates can work in governmental special education schools as well as the private special
            education and rehabilitation centers as special education teachers. Teachers who graduate from the teacher
            training programs can also attend to graduate programs. In the educational science institutes in related
            universities there are graduate programs for both masters and doctoral degrees. There are 10 universities
            providing undergraduate programs in special education. Besides, Anadolu, Gazi and Ankara universities provide
            masters and doctoral degree, and Abant Izzet Baysal and Istanbul universities provide only masters degree
            programs.</p>
